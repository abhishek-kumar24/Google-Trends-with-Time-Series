## Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data ðŸš€


> What can the popularity of search terms tell us about the world? Google Trends gives us access to the popularity of Google Search terms. Let's investigate: ðŸ˜€

- How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin

- How search volume for a hot stock like Telsa relates to that stock's price and

- How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States

## What I've learned:

âœ… How to make time-series data comparable by resampling and converting to the same periodicity (e.g., from daily data to monthly data).

âœ… Fine-tuning the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colours, and the chart's resolution.

âœ… Using grids to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.

âœ… Finding the number of missing and NaN values and how to locate NaN values in a DataFrame.

âœ… How to work with Locators to better style the time axis on a chart

âœ… Review the concepts learned in the previous three days and apply them to new datasets
